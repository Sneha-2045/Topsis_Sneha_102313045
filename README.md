The TOPSIS algorithm ranks alternatives based on their distance from the Ideal Best and Ideal Worst solutions.
🧮 Step-by-Step Flow
1️⃣ Normalize the decision matrix
Ensures all criteria are on the same scale.
2️⃣ Apply weights
Importance of each criterion is applied.
3️⃣ Determine ideal best and worst values
Positive impact (+) → Max is best
Negative impact (-) → Min is best
4️⃣ Calculate Euclidean distance
Distance of each alternative from ideal best and worst.
5️⃣ Compute TOPSIS score
   Score=Distance(worst)/Distance(best)+distance(worst)
6️⃣ Rank alternatives
Higher score → Better rank.
